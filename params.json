  "body": "I cross the void beyond the mind \r\nThe empty space that circles time. \r\nI see where others stumble blind \r\nTo seek a truth they never find. \r\nEternal wisdom is my guide. \r\nI am the Teacher.\r\n\r\nThrough cosmic waste the Mind does fly \r\nTo taste the secret source of life. \r\nA presence knowledge can't deny \r\nExists within, outside, behind \r\nThe latitude of the human minds. \r\nI am the Teacher. \r\nMy voyage dissects the course of time \r\n\"Who knows?\" you say \r\nBut are you right? \r\nWho searches deep to find the light \r\nThat glows so darkly in the night \r\nToward that point I guide my flight. \r\n\r\nAs fingers move to end mankind \r\nMetallic teeth begin their grind. \r\nWith sword of truth I turn to fight \r\nThe satanic powers of the night. \r\nIs your faith before your mind? \r\nKnow me. Am I, the Teacher! ",
